# Project 1: Data Analytics in Everyday Life

## Description
Data analytics is not just limited to technical fields but is a process we unknowingly use in our everyday life. For example, consider going to a market to buy something like a shirt, jeans, or footwear. Every step you take—from deciding what to buy to making the final purchase—mirrors the data analytics process.

This project explores how we can break down everyday decision-making tasks into steps of the **Data Analytics Process** and apply them in real-life scenarios.

## Data Analytics Process Steps

### 1. **Plan**:
   - **Real-life example**: Before going to the market, we decide on the things we need to buy (shirt, jeans, or footwear).
   - **Analytics parallel**: Defining the business objective and setting the scope of data analysis.

### 2. **Prepare**:
   - **Real-life example**: Check how much you're willing to spend and determine how to get the money (cash, card, or mobile wallet).
   - **Analytics parallel**: Collect and prepare data for analysis, ensuring that resources are available for successful data processing.

### 3. **Process**:
   - **Real-life example**: Decide what specific item you want, such as slippers, shoes, or sandals, depending on your needs.
   - **Analytics parallel**: Clean the data, remove any outliers, and organize it for further analysis.

### 4. **Analyze**:
   - **Real-life example**: You check the latest fashion trends and see if the items you have will pair well, such as determining if the jeans you already have will match the shirt you're considering buying.
   - **Analytics parallel**: Perform the actual analysis on the data, uncovering patterns, trends, and correlations.

### 5. **Share**:
   - **Real-life example**: You communicate your preferences to the shopkeeper and work together to find the best fit for your needs.
   - **Analytics parallel**: Share the findings and insights from the analysis with stakeholders to make informed decisions.

### 6. **Act**:
   - **Real-life example**: You make the final purchase based on all the analysis and decisions.
   - **Analytics parallel**: Implement the findings and recommendations in real-life business decisions.

## Task
Your task is to identify a real-life situation where the **Data Analytics Process** is used and create a PPT or PDF explaining it with the six steps: **Plan, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act**.

---

## Deliverables
- A **PPT/PDF** presenting a real-life example of using the Data Analytics process in a decision-making scenario.
- The file should include:
  - A real-life scenario breakdown.
  - Each step of the Data Analytics process explained using your chosen scenario.

---

## Tools
- **Microsoft PowerPoint** or **Google Slides** for the presentation.
- **PDF format** for the final submission if needed.

## Conclusion
This project highlights how we use data analytics in everyday life without even realizing it. Whether it’s making a purchase or deciding on an action, the same fundamental steps apply.
