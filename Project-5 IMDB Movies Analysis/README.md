# Project 5: IMDB Movie Analysis

## Description
This project aims to analyze various aspects of movies, such as their genres, durations, languages, directors, and budgets, and assess their impact on IMDB scores and financial success. The analysis provides insights into how different factors contribute to the overall performance and reception of movies.

Using Excel's powerful functions and tools, we conduct in-depth analysis on a dataset of movies, focusing on genre distribution, duration, language influence, director impact, and budget profitability.

## Key Areas of Analysis

### A. Movie Genre Analysis: Distribution and Impact on IMDB Score
- **Objective**: Analyze the distribution of movie genres and their impact on IMDB scores.
- **Task**:
  - Identify the most common movie genres.
  - Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation) of the IMDB scores for each genre.
- **Approach**:
  - Use Excel's `COUNTIF()` function to count occurrences of each genre.
  - Apply Excel's `AVERAGE()`, `MEDIAN()`, `MODE()`, `VAR()`, and `STDEV()` to analyze the impact of genres on IMDB scores.
  - Compare the descriptive statistics to understand how movie genres influence ratings.

### B. Movie Duration Analysis: Duration and Impact on IMDB Score
- **Objective**: Analyze the distribution of movie durations and assess their impact on IMDB scores.
- **Task**:
  - Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, and standard deviation) for movie durations.
  - Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between movie duration and IMDB score.
  - Add a trendline to observe the strength and direction of the relationship.
- **Approach**:
  - Use Excel's `AVERAGE()`, `MEDIAN()`, and `STDEV()` functions for duration analysis.
  - Create a scatter plot and add a trendline to observe any correlation between duration and IMDB score.

### C. Language Analysis: Distribution and Impact on IMDB Score
- **Objective**: Analyze the distribution of movies based on their language and the impact on IMDB scores.
- **Task**:
  - Identify the most common languages used in movies.
  - Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) of IMDB scores for each language.
- **Approach**:
  - Use `COUNTIF()` to find the number of movies for each language.
  - Apply `AVERAGE()`, `MEDIAN()`, and `STDEV()` to calculate statistics and understand how language influences ratings.

### D. Director Analysis: Influence of Directors on Movie Ratings
- **Objective**: Assess the influence of directors on movie ratings based on their average IMDB score.
- **Task**:
  - Identify top directors based on their average IMDB scores.
  - Use percentile calculations to analyze the success of directors in relation to the overall dataset.
- **Approach**:
  - Use `AVERAGEIF()` to calculate the average IMDB score for each director.
  - Apply Excelâ€™s `PERCENTILE()` function to find directors in the top percentile of IMDB scores.

### E. Budget Analysis: Relationship Between Budgets and Financial Success
- **Objective**: Explore the relationship between movie budgets and their financial success.
- **Task**:
  - Analyze the correlation between movie budgets and gross earnings.
  - Identify the movies with the highest profit margin.
- **Approach**:
  - Use Excel's `CORREL()` function to find the correlation coefficient between movie budgets and gross earnings.
  - Calculate the profit margin (gross earnings - budget) and identify the top movies with `MAX()`.
